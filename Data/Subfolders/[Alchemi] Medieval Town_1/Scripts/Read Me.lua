-= Medieval Town Kit =-

Hello! I built you a town.
The town is about 2570 objects without the 'Insta town' & 'Trees-Placed' folders.
The are both only there to show possible arrangements.

► The 'Ground Pieces' Folder
 'Grass' are walkable flat mesh pieces to blend the sculpt terrain to the canal edges clean. 
 
► Terrain-  * You can find this as a started map project if you look in 
  Community Projects/ for [Alchemi] Medieval Town
 Hey! So Core does this cool thing~ you can have More Than ONE ^_^
 I have two in here.
 'Terrain' is walkable. The second, 'Terrain-No walk' is only a decorative mountain surround.
✖ Dont like my mountains? Just delete it! It makes no difference to the walkable village terrain.
 Want to add your own custom surround? 
 At the top of your Core editor- There is a blue button that looks like a mountain.
 Select generate terrain, choose a preset and modify/ sculpt and paint until your heart is content.
 Make sure to set which ever you want to walk on as PRIMARY.
